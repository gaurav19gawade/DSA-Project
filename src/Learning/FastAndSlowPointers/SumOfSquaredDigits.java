/**
Number of times you divide a number by 10 is equal to number of digits in original number
Whereas log 10 (100) = 2 because 10 ^ 2 = 100

A number n has d digits if and only if: 10^(d-1) ≤ n < 10^d
Example d-1 < log(100) < d
n = 100 i.e log (100) = 2 because 10 ^ 2 = 100
log2 (8) = 3 because 2 ^ 3 = 8

/**
 * Certainly! Here's a summary to help you understand logarithms in the context of our "Happy Number" problem and digit manipulation:
 *
 * 1. Logarithms and Digits:
 *    - The number of digits in a number n is approximately log₁₀(n) + 1.
 *    - log₁₀(n) tells us how many times we can divide n by 10 before reaching 0.
 *
 * 2. Why This Matters:
 *    - In our algorithm, we process each digit by repeatedly dividing by 10.
 *    - The number of times we do this is related to the number of digits.
 *
 * 3. Efficiency Implication:
 *    - As numbers get larger, the number of digits (and thus operations) grows logarithmically, not linearly.
 *    - This makes our algorithm efficient even for very large numbers.
 *
 * 4. Practical Example:
 *    - 10 has 2 digits, log₁₀(10) ≈ 1
 *    - 1000 has 4 digits, log₁₀(1000) = 3
 *    - 1,000,000 has 7 digits, log₁₀(1,000,000) = 6
 *
 * 5. Key Takeaway:
 *    - Logarithmic growth is much slower than linear growth.
 *    - This is why algorithms with logarithmic time complexity are considered efficient.
 *
 * Remember: When you see log in algorithm analysis, it often indicates that the algorithm's performance grows slowly relative to the input size, which is good for efficiency.

/**
 * You're absolutely right! That statement is indeed the key to understanding the relationship between logarithms and our digit-processing algorithm. Let's elaborate on this crucial insight:
 *
 * 1. Direct Application:
 *    - In our sumOfSquaredDigits function, we're literally dividing by 10 repeatedly until we reach 0.
 *    - The number of times we do this division is exactly what log₁₀(n) represents.
 *
 * 2. Examples:
 *    - For 100:
 *      100 → 10 → 1 → 0 (2 divisions, log₁₀(100) = 2)
 *    - For 1234:
 *      1234 → 123 → 12 → 1 → 0 (4 divisions, log₁₀(1234) ≈ 3.09)
 *
 * 3. Why It's Powerful:
 *    - This directly correlates to the number of iterations in our loop.
 *    - It explains why the function's runtime grows slowly as numbers get larger.
 *
 * 4. Generalization:
 *    - In base b, logb(n) tells us how many times we can divide n by b before reaching 0.
 *    - This concept applies to other bases, not just 10.
 *
 * 5. Time Complexity:
 *    - Because of this relationship, we can confidently say our function has O(log n) time complexity.
 *
 * 6. Practical Implication:
 *    - Even for very large numbers, we don't need to do many divisions.
 *    - This is why the algorithm remains efficient for big inputs.
 *
 * Your observation highlights the beautiful connection between a mathematical concept (logarithms) and a practical programming technique (digit extraction through division). This understanding is crucial in algorithm analysis and design, especially when dealing with problems involving digit manipulation or repeated division.
